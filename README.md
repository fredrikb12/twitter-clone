## Possible improvements

### UI / UX

- Provide secondary theme for those preferring a lighter look.
- Improve responsiveness across screen sizes, particularly mobile.
- Develop mobile-specific menu for improved navigation and design.

### Code

- Make better use of Styled Components, in order to create easily reusable components across the application.
- Choose better names for variables and components, in order to more easily understand each component.
- Use less inline styling, to make each component shorter.

## Reflections

This project was significantly more difficult in terms of modelling data and choosing how different documents should relate to one another. I don't believe my approach was very pragmatic - although it did work how I wanted it to - the issue lies in the Firestore security rules, where I believe users potentially have more power than they should be allowed to currently. Fortunately, as I've now (July 2022) gotten experience with MongoDB, Node, and Express, I have a much better understanding of how to handle databases and server-side functionality in general.

Overall, I feel the design is rather slick this time around; it certainly helps having something to base it off of. The general colors are the same as one of Twitter's color schemes, in order to provide a similar feeling in this application.

I felt it was a great project to finish with, before moving on to the back end and learning how to create the server myself. It really made me condense all that I'd learned so far, and pour it into this one application. There can always be improvements, but I'm currently pleased with the result!
